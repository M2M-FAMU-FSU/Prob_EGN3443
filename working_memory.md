# Working Memory
## The "Commands"
1. jupyter-book build ./Prob_EGN3443/ 
2. ghp-import -n -p -f _build/html


## 1/4/26
* Prep for the first class
    * All Projects
        * Projects need soft deadline and hard-deadline. 
    * Clear about what is first module, i.e., first HW and exam.  


* Getting a hang of things
    * Probability - Pmfs, Pdfs, cdfs, 
    * Sample Space, Events? (set theory??)
    * Expected values - X, h(X)
    * "Modeling" - Point Estimates (MLE, Method of Moments)
    * Central Limit Theorem
    * Joint probabilities, Conditional distributions 
    * Hypothesis Testing 
        * Single sample Z-test
        * Single sample t-Test
        * Two-sample Z-test
        * Two-sample t-test




## 1/6/26
* Some Examples ideas
    * What is the probability of a car waiting twice at a signal?
    * 


## 1/8/26 (After first class)
* Moving proper introduction to events - "multiple random variables,etc." to later part of the course! (probably after I reach CLT)
    * this includes set theory-based things. 
    * Independence and things like that!


## 1/14/26 (Lagging Behind)
* Need to prep for Module 2
* Need to create HW1 Solutions
* Need to Publish Exam 1
* Create Project Teams 
* Create Project 1 (partially test its working)


## 1/15/26
* Was able to only cover permutations, combinations, and set theory today. 


## 1/26/26
* For figures in CAREER proposal: 
Some sort of relational data between various fields (calculus, probability, statistics, physics, materials science, thermodynamics, manufacturing, AI, machine learning, computer coding, algebra, research, industry work) is useful - kind of a general perception! - This is specific to the “subject” 

* **I am rethinking everything**
 * Why not make the (rest of my) classes a bunch of problems? - They think and then I introduce the concepts!
    * The problems need not encapsulate everything. 
    * Adversarial Questions
        * Can I include mathematical questions?
        * Students do not care anyway? - Well, they might but it's a bigger threshold!- and you can only get better over the years!
        * Lots of effort - I can get money for doing my "teaching" as well!! - I can get more people (graduate students) involved in my teaching! - I can totally flip how teaching is done! 

 * Just started prob-a-day 
    * Will make a single markdown that I use to add content daily -
