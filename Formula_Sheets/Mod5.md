# Module 5 - Formula Sheet (3 Sessions, Under Construction) 

## Missed "some" distributions
## Missed 'joint' distributions and covariance!  

**Law of Large Numbers**

### 7. Students' t-distribution $t(n-1)$
* Variable (continuous), $x \in (-\infty,\infty)$
* $n$ is the sample size typically
* $n-1$ degrees of freedom

### 8. Chi-squared Distribution $\chi^2(n-1)$
* Variable (continuous) but can only take positive real numbers $x \in [0,\infty)$
* $n$ is the sample size typically
* $n-1$ degrees of freedom
