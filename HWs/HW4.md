1. Shade to show appropriate values on a figure of normal pdf with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. Draw a figure for each case. 
    * $p(x \leq a)$, where $a < \mu$.
    * $p(x = b)$, where $b < \mu$.
    * $F(c)$, where $c > \mu$.
    * $F(d)$, where $d = \mu$.

2. For the previous problem, provide the corresponding values for $\mu=0$ and $\sigma^2 = 1$
    * $a = -0.2$.
    * $b = -0.1$.
    * $c = 0.25$.
    * $d = \mu = 0$.
    * Additionally, provide the values of $\Phi(0.25)$ and $\Phi(0)$. Comment on their similarity/difference from $F(0.25)$ and $F(0)$.


3. For a Binomial distribution $B(10,0.3)$,
    * Find $p(8)$.
    * Find $p(x \leq 8)$.
    * Find $F(1)$

4. $X \sim \mathcal{N}(6,1.5^2)$. Find
    * $P(4 \leq X \leq 6)$
    * $P(7.5 \leq X \leq 9.5)$
    * $P(5.5 \leq X \leq 7)$  
    * $F(6)$ 
    * $P(X \geq 10.5)$

5. Say, you toss a fair $(p = 0.4)$ coin 30 times and note *Heads* as success $(1)$ and *Tails* as failure $(0)$. 
    * What is the probability that number of *Heads* you get is greater than 25?
    * What is the probability that number of *Heads* you get is 15 or 16?
    * What is the probability that the value $\frac{\# of heads}{Total \# of tosses}$ is greater than $0.5$? 
    * What is the probability that the value $\frac{\# of heads}{Total \# of tosses}$  is greater than $0.5$ if you toss the coin 50 times? Is it different from the previous answer?
