(Chapters 1, 2, 3, and 4 in Textbook)



## Sample/Data
* Numerical Data
* Categorical Data 

## Basic "Descriptive" Statistics
Descriptive Statistics describe a sample. 

### Pictorial Descriptions 
* Histogram - $~\sqrt{n}$ number of bins (rule of thumb)
    * Frequency vs Relative Frequency
* Box Plot

### Numerical Descriptions
* Mean $\bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}$
* Percentile-related
    * Median $\tilde{x} = \begin{cases} n \text{ is odd} \implies  (\frac{n+1}{2})^{th} \text{ ordered value} \\ n \text{ is even} \implies \text{average of } (\frac{n}{2})^{th} \text{ and } (\frac{n+1}{2})^{th} \text{ ordered value }\end{cases}$
    * Quartiles - Lower (Q1), Median (Q2), Upper(Q3)

* Measure of Variability
    * (Sample) Variance $s^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n}  \frac{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n -1}$ 
    * Std. Dev. $s = \sqrt{s^2}$

### Basic Excel Commands
* AVERAGE
* VAR.S 
* STDEV.S
* PERCENTILE.INC
* MAX 
* MIN



## Mathematical Notations
*You can try writing in LaTeX (search for Overleaf) or Markdown to learn how to "type" mathematics.*

* Curly Braces - $\{\}$ 
    * Denote a *set* 
    * Typically includes values with comma
    * E.g. $\{1,2,4,7,2\}$ 

* Square Brackets - $[a,b]$
    * Denote closed interval from $a$ to $b$ including $a$ and $b$
    * $a$ must be less than $b$ (by convention)

* Paranthesis - $(a,b)$
    * Denote open interval from $a$ to $b$ that does not include $a$ or $b$
    * $a$ must be less than $b$ (by convention)

* Mixed - $[a,b)$
    * Includes $a$ but not $b$ 
    * And vice versa

* $\subset$ - Subset
* $\in$ - 'belongs to' 



<!-- ## Concepts
* Fundamental Goal: Make decisions (a.k.a design)
    * Examples: How many parking spots do we need at the COE?
    * Examples: Do we allow more construction in Tallahassee downtown area?
    * Examples: How long/short the (timer-based) traffic signals should show red/green?
    * Examples: Does Aspirin reduce headache?
    * Examples: How long will your car function without trouble? -->

<!-- * Sample vs Population
    * Mean, Median, Quartiles, Percentiles, 
    * Variance and Standard Deviation
    * Histogram and Box Plots -->
