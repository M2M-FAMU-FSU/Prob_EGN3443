# Coffee Discussion
### **Intro/Module 1: Session \#1** (in prep)
Have you faced issues with parking or seen cars parked on grass at COE? How can you design the number of parking spots necessary?

### **Module 2 (Session \#5)** 
You are designing a bridge. A structural engineer asks you, will the bridge fail? There are some known causes (listed below). 
* Dead loads (the bridge structure itself) 
* Live loads (moving vehicles/people) 
* Winds
* Rain 
* Snow
* Heat
* Earthquakes 
   
**Prompts**
*  How will you answer - "will the bridge fail"? 
*  Describe all the information/data you need (which may be available or collectable). 
*  How will you make sense of that information?
*  How will you give a mathematical form to this (Hint: define Sample Space, Event, Probability)?
