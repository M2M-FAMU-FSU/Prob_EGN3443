# Working Memory
## The "Commands"
1. jupyter-book build ./Prob_EGN3443/ 
2. ghp-import -n -p -f _build/html


## 1/4/26
* Prep for the first class
    * All Projects
        * Projects need soft deadline and hard-deadline. 
    * Clear about what is first module, i.e., first HW and exam.  


* Getting a hang of things
    * Probability - Pmfs, Pdfs, cdfs, 
    * Sample Space, Events? (set theory??)
    * Expected values - X, h(X)
    * "Modeling" - Point Estimates (MLE, Method of Moments)
    * Central Limit Theorem
    * Joint probabilities, Conditional distributions 
    * Hypothesis Testing 
        * Single sample Z-test
        * Single sample t-Test
        * Two-sample Z-test
        * Two-sample t-test




## 1/6/26
* Some Examples ideas
    * What is the probability of a car waiting twice at a signal?
    * 


## 1/8/26 (After first class)
* Moving proper introduction to events - "multiple random variables,etc." to later part of the course! (probably after I reach CLT)
    * this includes set theory-based things. 
    * Independence and things like that!


## 1/14/26 (Lagging Behind)
* Need to prep for Module 2
* Need to create HW1 Solutions
* Need to Publish Exam 1
* Create Project Teams 
* Create Project 1 (partially test its working)


## 1/15/26
* Was able to only cover permutations, combinations, and set theory today.
