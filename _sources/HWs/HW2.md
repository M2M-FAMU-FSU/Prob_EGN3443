1. Verify De Morgan's Laws through venn diagrams. For each law, draw two diagrams for each side of inequality (totaling eight diagrams). Each diagram will correspond to one operation ($\cup$,$'$, or $\cap$). Use shading or color to differeniate sets ($A$,$A'$,$B$,$B'$) from each other. 
    * **Law 1**: $(A \cup B)' = A' \cap B' $
    * **Law 2**: $(A \cap B)' = A' \cup B' $

7. We have a deck of randomly shuffled typical playing cards (if you do not know about cards, please check online). 
    * If we choose one card at random, 
        * What is the appropriate sample space and its size?
        * What is the probability for an event that the card is black?
    * If we choose two cards together randomly,
        * What is the sample space?
        * What is the probability for an event that both the cards are black?
        * What is the probability for an event that one card is black and one card is red?
    * If we choose two cards one-after-another after replacing the card
        * What is the sample space and its size?
        * What is the probability for an event that both the cards are black?
        * What is the probability for an event that one card is black and one card is red?

5. Answer (Hint: use $P(\Omega) = 1$) 
    *  1.1 $g(x) = 1 \,\, \forall \,\, \omega \in \Omega; \Omega  = [0,1]$. Is the function $g$ a pdf, a pmf, or neither?
    *  1.2. $g(x) = 1/2 \,\, \forall \,\, \omega \in \Omega; \Omega = \{Stone, Paper, Scissor\} $. Is the function $g$ a pdf, a pmf, or neither?
    *   1.3. $g(x) = |\omega| \,\, \forall \,\, \omega \in \Omega; \Omega = [-1,1] $. Is the function $g$ a pdf, a pmf, or neither? 
        *Note:  $|\omega| = \begin{cases} \omega, \,\, if \,\, \omega \geq 0 \\ -\omega, \,\, if \,\, \omega < 0 \\ \end{cases} $ (known as absolute value function)*   
    *   1.4. $g(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{8\pi}}\exp(-\frac{\omega^2}{8}) \forall \,\, \omega \in \Omega; \Omega = (-\infty,\infty)$. Is the function $g$ a pdf, a pmf, or neither?
