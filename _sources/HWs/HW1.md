1. Textbook Section 1.4 Problem \# 45 

2. Textbook Chapter 1 Supplementary Exercises \# 63 (Histogram, mean, percentiles, variance, and box plot (optional))


3.  Mention the appropriate type of sample/data you can get (numerical or categorical), discrete or continuous (if numerical), and size of the sample. 
    * An engineer marks each manufactured part in a batch of fifty parts as defective or not. 
    * You count the number of car arrivals everyday (for a semester) at the COE. 
    * We measure heights of people in EGN3443. 
    * You measure waiting times (assume entry to exit) at the COE cafe for people in EGN3443.
    * We measure temperature at Tallahassee everyday in January. 
    * You roll a die ten times.  

4. From the previous question,
    * Define an appropriate sample space ($\Omega$) for each case from the previous question (each answer must be a set). 
    * For each sample space ($\Omega$), what is the physical meaning of a random variable defined in that sample space?
    * For each random variable, what are all the potential values it can take?

3. Answer (Hint: use $P(\Omega) = 1$) 
    *  1.1 $g(x) = 1 \,\, \forall \,\, \omega \in \Omega; \Omega  = [0,1]$. Is the function $g$ a pdf, a pmf, or neither?
    *  1.2. $g(x) = 1/2 \,\, \forall \,\, \omega \in \Omega; \Omega = \{Stone, Paper, Scissor\} $. Is the function $g$ a pdf, a pmf, or neither?
    *   1.3. $g(x) = |\omega| \,\, \forall \,\, \omega \in \Omega; \Omega = [-1,1] $. Is the function $g$ a pdf, a pmf, or neither? 
        *Note:  $|\omega| = \begin{cases} \omega, \,\, if \,\, \omega \geq 0 \\ -\omega, \,\, if \,\, \omega < 0 \\ \end{cases} $ (known as absolute value function)*   
    *   1.4. $g(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{8\pi}}\exp(-\frac{\omega^2}{8}) \forall \,\, \omega \in \Omega; \Omega = (-\infty,\infty)$. Is the function $g$ a pdf, a pmf, or neither?
