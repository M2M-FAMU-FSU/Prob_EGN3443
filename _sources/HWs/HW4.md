3. Shade to show appropriate values on a figure of normal pdf with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. Draw a figure for each case. 
    * $p(x \leq a)$, where $a < \mu$.
    * $p(x = b)$, where $b < \mu$.
    * $F(c)$, where $c > \mu$.
    * $F(d)$, where $d = \mu$.

4. From problem 3, provide the corresponding values for $\mu=0$ and $\sigma^2 = 1$
    * $a = -0.2$.
    * $b = -0.1$.
    * $c = 0.25$.
    * $d = \mu = 0$.
    * Additionally, provide the values of $\Phi(0.25)$ and $\Phi(0)$. Comment on their similarity/difference from $F(0.25)$ and $F(0)$.


5. For a Binomial distribution $B(10,0.3)$,
    * Find $p(8)$.
    * Find $p(x \leq 8)$.
    * Find $F(1)$

8. You are redesigning a mobile app. You want to know if users think the "Profile" icon also contains "Settings." You assume 70% of users expect Settings to be under "Profile" (industry standard). In a usability test with 5 users, 4 of them immediately click the "Hamburger Menu" instead.

Design Decision: Design Insight: This allows students to objectively admit when their design hypothesis was wrong. Instead of arguing about "best practices," they update their "belief" based on the 4 users they just watched.


10. **IMPORTANT Survey Question**: Testing modalities of teaching
