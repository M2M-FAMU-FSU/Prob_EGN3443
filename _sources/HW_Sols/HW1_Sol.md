1. Textbook Section 1.4 Problem \# 45 
$$116.4 \,\, 115.9 \,\, 114.6  \,\, 115.2 \,\, 115.8$$
Mean
$\bar{x} = \frac{116.4 + 115.9 + 114.6 + 115.2 + 115.8}{5} = 115.58 $

**Deviations** ($x_i - \bar{x}$)
  $$0.82 \,\, 0.32 \,\, -0.98  \,\, -0.38 \,\, 0.22$$

Variance $s^2 = \frac{0.82^2 + 0.32^2 + (-0.98)^2 + (-0.38)^2 + 0.22^2}{5 -1} = 0.482$

Standard deviation $s = 0.694$.

3.  Mention the appropriate type of sample/data you can get (numerical or categorical), discrete or continuous (if numerical), and size of the sample. 
    * An engineer marks each manufactured part in a batch of fifty parts as defective or not. *Categorical, -, 50 (It is not incorrect to think of it directly as 0 and 1)*
    * You count the number of car arrivals everyday (for a semester) at the COE. *Numerical, Discrete, 120* 
    * We measure heights of people in EGN3443. *Numerical, Continuous, 37 (or whatever the number of assumed people in class)*
    * You measure waiting times (assume entry to exit) at the COE cafe for people in EGN3443. *Numerical, Continuous, 37 (or whatever the number of assumed people in class)*
    * We measure temperature at Tallahassee everyday in January. *Numerical, Continuous, 31 (days)*
    * You roll a die ten times.  *Numerical, Discrete, 10* (perhaps, it is not incorrect to imagine die [like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/13k515g/trying_to_identify_what_game_this_die_comes_from/) will result in a non-number)

4. From the previous question, define an appropriate sample space ($\Omega$) for each case (each answer must be a set).
    * $\Omega$ = {'Defective','NotDefective'} (also $\{0,1\}$ is also okay)
    * $\Omega = \{0,1,2,...,\infty\}$ 
    * $\Omega = (0,\infty)$ or $\mathbb{R}^+$ (just a fancy notation)
    * $\Omega = (0,\infty)$ or $\mathbb{R}^+$ 
    * $\Omega = (-\infty,\infty)$ or $\mathbb{R}$ 
    * $\Omega = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$ or whatever your 'options' are in a die 

5. There is no fixed rule to define your random variable as long as each element in the sample space has a number - Answers may vary a lot!
    * $X = \begin{cases} 0, \text{if not defective} \\ 1, \text{if defective} \end{cases}$
    * $X$ is number of car arrivals (or)  $X$ is number of excess cars defined as the difference between number of car arrivals and the total number of parking spots
    * $X$ is the heights of people in feet or inches (or)  $X = \begin{cases} 0, \text{if height} \geq 72 inches  \\ 1, \text{if height}< 72 inches \end{cases}$
    * $X$ is the waiting time in seconds or minutes. (or)  $X = \begin{cases} 0, \text{if time} \geq 10 minutes \\ 1, \text{} < 10 minutes \end{cases}$
    * $X$ is rolled number   

6.  Answers correspond to Q5
    * $\{0, 1\}$
    * $\{0,1,2,...,\infty\}$ (or)  $\{-\infty,...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...,\infty\}$
    * $(0,\infty)$ (or)   $\{0, 1\}$
    * $(0,\infty)$ (or)   $\{0, 1\}$
    * $\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$
