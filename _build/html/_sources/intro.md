# Statistical Topics in Engineering (EGN3443)

* I am teaching this course for the first time (may be even the last time) in Spring 2026 at the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering. So, well, I might do a lot of experiments with you.   

--- 
* This website is intended to be a bunch of formula sheets and HW questions. If you continue next semester to take the Quality Control and Reliability Engineering (ESI4234) course, if you are (un)lucky, you will see this type of thing again! 

---
* This course is fairly mathematical and provides one of the fundamental ways to look at things around us and our own life. 
* I hope you ignore grades and enjoy learning!  

### Acknowledgements
* A lot of content in this website can be attributed to the [textbook](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~qfsong/teaching/511/probability_and_statistics_for_engineering_and_the_sciences.pdf) and Dr. Lichun Li who has been teaching this course for quite a few years and generously shared her materials with me.
