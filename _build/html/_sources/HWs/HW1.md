2. Textbook Chapter 1 Supplementary Exercises \# 63 (histogram, mean, variance, standard deviation, quartiles (including median), maximum, minimum, and range) - You may use Excel ([dataset here](https://fsu-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/rg24o_fsu_edu/IQBmUNSsiW1ySpIE-SGwI-7PAd8sVwYVBiV6tnHhBbpZcvI?e=5WCFjG)). 


3.  Mention the appropriate type of sample/data you can get (numerical or categorical), discrete or continuous (if numerical), and size of the sample. 
    * An engineer marks each manufactured part in a batch of fifty parts as defective or not.

    * You roll a die ten times.  

4. From the previous question, define an appropriate sample space ($\Omega$) for each case (each answer must be a set). 

5. For each sample space ($\Omega$), what is the physical meaning of a random variable defined in that sample space?

6. For each random variable, what are all the values it can potentially take?
