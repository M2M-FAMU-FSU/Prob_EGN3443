1. Verify De Morgan's Laws through venn diagrams. For each law, draw two diagrams for each side of inequality (totaling eight diagrams). Each diagram will correspond to one operation ($\cup$,$'$, or $\cap$). Use shading or color to differeniate sets ($A$,$A'$,$B$,$B'$) from each other. 
    * **Law 1**: $(A \cup B)' = A' \cap B' $
    * **Law 2**: $(A \cap B)' = A' \cup B' $

7. We have a deck of randomly shuffled typical playing cards (if you do not know about cards, please check online). 
    * If we choose one card at random, 
        * What is the appropriate sample space and its size?
        * What is the probability for an event that the card is black?
    * If we choose two cards together randomly,
        * What is the appropriate sample space and its size?
        * What is the probability for an event that both the cards are black?
        * What is the probability for an event that one card is black and one card is red?
    * If we choose two cards one-after-another after replacing the card
        * What is the appropriate sample space and its size?
        * What is the probability for an event that both the cards are black?
        * What is the probability for an event that one card is black and one card is red?


8. (A classical problem) COVID-19 tests are known to detect correctly 99\% of the times when the virus is present on the swab. However, the test also incorrectly detects (false-positive) 2\% of the time when the virus is not present on the swab. Assume 10\% of the population have COVID-19 right now. If you take a COVID-19 test and it turns out to be (unfortunately) positive, what is the probability that you have COVID-19?

    * Additionally, write the definitions of sample space and events, that help you formulate this problem to calculate the probability values? Draw a relevant Venn diagram, if possible. 

12. Car manufacturing can be considered an assembly of 500 independent components. If 99.9\% of cars needs to be defect-free, 
    * What is the allowable defect rate (probability) for a component? (convert the obtained value to *parts-per-million* or *ppm*)
    * Write the definitions of sample space and events, that help you formulate this problem to calculate the probability of defective cars? Draw a relevant Venn diagram, if possible.
