1. Answer (Hint: use $P(\Omega) = 1$) 
    *  1.1 $g(x) = 1 \,\, \forall \,\, x \in X; X  = [0,1]$. Is the function $g$ a pdf, a pmf, or neither?
    *  1.2. $g(x) = 1/2 \,\, \forall \,\, x \in X$; $X = \{1,2,3\}$ . Is the function $g$ a pdf, a pmf, or neither?
    *   1.3. $g(x) = |x| \,\, \forall \,\, x \in X; X = [-1,1] $. Is the function $g$ a pdf, a pmf, or neither? 
        *Note:  $|x| = \begin{cases} x, \,\, if \,\, x \geq 0 \\ -x, \,\, if \,\, x < 0 \\ \end{cases} $ (known as absolute value function)*   
    *   1.4. $g(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{8\pi}}\exp(-\frac{x^2}{8}) \forall \,\, x \in X; X = (-\infty,\infty)$. Is the function $g$ a pdf, a pmf, or neither?


2. Find the expected value of $X$, if 
    * $X \sim Binomial(p)$
    * $X \sim Poisson(\lambda)$
    * $X \sim Uniform(a,b)$
    * $X \sim Exponential(\lambda)$

3. For a uniform distribution $U(5,8)$ 
    * What is the probability $p(5.5)$?
    * What is $f(5.5)$?
    * What are $F(0.2)$, $F(5.5)$, and $F(8.5)$?

8. You are redesigning a mobile app. You want to know if users think the "Profile" icon also contains "Settings." You assume 70% of users expect Settings to be under "Profile" (industry standard). In a usability test with 5 users, 4 of them immediately click the "Hamburger Menu" instead.

Design Decision: Design Insight: This allows students to objectively admit when their design hypothesis was wrong. Instead of arguing about "best practices," they update their "belief" based on the 4 users they just watched.
