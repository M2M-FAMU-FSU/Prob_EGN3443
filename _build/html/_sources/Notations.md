# Mathematical Notations
*You can try writing in LaTeX (search for Overleaf) or Markdown to learn how to "type" mathematics.*

### Set Theory
* Curly Braces - $\{\}$ 
    * Denote a *set* 
    * Typically includes values with comma
    * E.g. $\{1,2,4,7,2\}$ 

* Square Brackets - $[a,b]$
    * Denote closed interval from $a$ to $b$ including $a$ and $b$
    * $a$ must be less than $b$ (by convention)

* Paranthesis - $(a,b)$
    * Denote open interval from $a$ to $b$ that does not include $a$ or $b$
    * $a$ must be less than $b$ (by convention)

* Mixed - $[a,b)$
    * Includes $a$ but not $b$ 
    * And vice versa



* $\in$ - belongs to
* $\notin$ - does not belong to
* $\subseteq$  - Subset 
* $\subset$ - Proper Subset
* $\cup$ - Union
* $\cap$ - Intersection
* $A'$ - complement of $A$
* $\phi$ - Null set. 


### Permutations and Combinations
* $^nC_r$ or $ n\choose r$ - n *choose* r
* $^nP_r$  - n *permute* r



## Basic Probability Notations  (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)
* $p$ - Probability or Probability Mass Function (pmf, attributes, discrete)
* $f$ - Probability Distribution Function (pdf, variables, continuous) *** 
* $F$ - Cumulative Distribution Function (cdf)
