# Mathematical Notations
*You can try writing in LaTeX (search for Overleaf) or Markdown to learn how to "type" mathematics.*

* Curly Braces - $\{\}$ 
    * Denote a *set* 
    * Typically includes values with comma
    * E.g. $\{1,2,4,7,2\}$ 

* Square Brackets - $[a,b]$
    * Denote closed interval from $a$ to $b$ including $a$ and $b$
    * $a$ must be less than $b$ (by convention)

* Paranthesis - $(a,b)$
    * Denote open interval from $a$ to $b$ that does not include $a$ or $b$
    * $a$ must be less than $b$ (by convention)

* Mixed - $[a,b)$
    * Includes $a$ but not $b$ 
    * And vice versa

* $\subset$ - Subset
* $\in$ - 'belongs to'
